# Analogue Clock Reader

This little project reads analogue clocks by generating every possbile clockface and finding out which one matches best.

## Limitations

Currently, the following assumptions are made:
- The clock is perfectly centerd in the image
- The clock hands are straight lines and dark
- The thrid clock hand is missing or has necligible visual impact
