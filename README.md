# Analogue Clock Reader

This little project reads analogue clocks by generating every possbile clockface and finding out which one matches best.

## Limitations

Currently, the following assumptions are made:
- The clock is round and its boundary is detectable in the image
- The clock is photographed from the front
- The clock hands are straight lines and dark
